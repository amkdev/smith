# Usage
Smith adds these functions to the settings 'cog' icon, in the top-right of each matrix block.

### Clone
To clone a block, select `Clone` in the settings menu for a block. This will add a new block at the end of your existing blocks, with the content duplicated. You can only clone a single block at a time.

### Copy
To copy a block, select `Copy` in the settings menu for a block. You can also select multiple blocks to be copied using the checkboxes in the top-left of any block (next to the title). This will save blocks to local storage, for pasting later.

### Paste
To paste a single block, or multiple blocks, select `Paste` in the settings menu for a block. This will paste all copied blocks at the end of your existing blocks.

You can only paste from blocks that were copied from the same Matrix field. However, this will work across entries and sections. You cannot copy blocks from one matrix field to another (the blocks will most likely be different).
